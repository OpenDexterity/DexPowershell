# DexPowershell

PowerShell module that can perform actions with Dexterity files.

# System Requirements

* Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 and newer are recommended. Module has not been tested on Linux, macOS, or older versions of Windows so your mileage may vary.
* PowerShell 5.1 or later (included in Windows by default since Windows 10 1607 and Windows Server 2016)

*Note: Administrator privileges may be required if operating on dictionaries in the GP or Dexterity install folders*

# Installation

Clone the repository by going up to the Code dropdown, then hit download ZIP. Extract the PowerShell files (.ps1, .psm1, .psd1) from the ZIP file into your documents folder -> WindowsPowerShell -> Modules -> DexPowershell. If any of those folders don't exist, it's safe to create them and PowerShell will still detect the module.
